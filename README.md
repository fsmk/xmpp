# xmpp

Hi, we at FSMK(https://fsmk.org) have our own XMPP(Jabber) service that we use for all of our internal communication. 
The server software used for hosting the XMPP service is [Prosody](https://prosody.im). 

## Why XMPP ?
We decided to use XMPP because it's open source and free. It is in line with the values and principles that we here at FSMK stand for. As the saying goes "Follow what you preach!"

## Why our own server instead of using some already existing server ?
We decided to set-up and maintain our own server becasue 
- It's way cooler to have your own hostname
- It gives us the flexibility to customise the server as per our own needs.
- It also creates a learning opportunity for our interns and volunteers.

# Features of our service
- It allows anyone to create an account
- We have a Let's Encypt certificate for our host
- encryption is priority
- Group creation si disabled by default. Only admins can create groups.
- Chats sent from multiple clients syncs on both/all of the devices.
