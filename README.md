# XMPP

Hi, we at [Free Software Movement Karnataka](https://fsmk.org) have our own XMPP(Jabber) service that we use for all of our internal communication. 
The server software used for hosting the XMPP service is [Prosody](https://prosody.im). 

## Why XMPP?
We decided to use XMPP because it is [free as in freedom software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software), which is in line with the values and principles FSMK stand for. As the saying goes "Practice what you preach!"

## Why host our own server instead of using some existing server?
We decided to set-up and maintain our own server becasue 
- It's way cooler to have your own hostname
- It gives us the flexibility to customise the server as per our own needs.
- It also creates a learning opportunity for our interns and volunteers.

# Features of our service
- It allows anyone to create an account
- We have a Let's Encypt certificate for our host
- secure communication, which includes encryption, and privacy are a priority
- Chats sent from multiple clients syncs on both/all of the devices. 

# Current Admins
- Sohom Bhattacharjee <sohom154@fsmk.org>
- Shijil TV <shijil@fsmk.org>
- Vikram Vincent <vincentvikram@fsmk.org>

### More admin(s) may be added as per request


# Recommended clients
- Conversations (Android)
- Pidgin (Linux) ( this client does not support encryption)
- [Converse.js](https://conversejs.org/) (web client)

## Why use this repo
- This repo will hold all the important and relevant details about our XMPP service
- Users can use the 'issues' page to report bugs and/or request new features
- Details on how to set-up and start using this service will be updated here too.
